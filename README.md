# Sushi POS API

A modern Point of Sale (POS) system built for restaurants, originally inspired by a local all-you-can-eat sushi place in Durham, NC. I started this project to explore full-stack development and build something useful that could streamline restaurant operations like menu customization, order processing, and table tracking. While it started with sushi in mind, itâ€™s flexible enough to be used for any kind of restaurant.

This project has taught me a ton about database design, backend API development, and frontend UI integration. I'm continuing to build this out with the goal of making it a full-scale solution for small and mid-sized restaurants.
## Project Structure

- `app/`: Backend FastAPI application
  - `api/`: API endpoints
  - `models/`: Database models
  - `schemas/`: Pydantic schemas
  - `core/`: Core functionality
  - `db/`: Database configuration
- `frontend/`: React frontend application
  - `src/`: Source code
    - `components/`: Reusable UI components
    - `pages/`: Page components
    - `services/`: API service calls
    - `contexts/`: React context providers

## Setup Instructions

### Backend Setup

1. Create and activate virtual environment:
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Start the backend server:
```bash
uvicorn app.main:app --reload
```

### Frontend Setup

1. Navigate to frontend directory:
```bash
cd frontend
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Start the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

## API Documentation

Once the backend server is running, you can access the API documentation at:
- Swagger UI: http://localhost:8000/docs
- ReDoc: http://localhost:8000/redoc
